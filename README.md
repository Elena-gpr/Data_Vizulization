# Data Visualization

The cost of living index is an economic indicator that measures the cost of living for households to maintain the same level of satisfaction. It is important to note that the cost of living index is different from the consumer price index (CPI); the latter measures the price changes of the same quantities of the same goods and services.

For this project, the data was obtained from:

- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mvieira101/global-cost-of-living
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zedataweaver/global-salary-data 
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankanhore545/cost-of-living-index-2022
Objectives

To provide an overview of the cost of living in various cities and countries around the world.

### Observations

1. Basic expenses are considered to be the sum of markets, utilities, and gasoline.
2. In the table "Monthly Expenses by City," the data is sorted in descending order by expense.
3. In the "Summary" section, specifically under "Savings," there are several countries where this value is negative. This indicates that the average salary is lower than the expenses.
